Github, stop selling tech to ICE

As of October 31st, 2019, I am removing all of my repositories from Github, and placing them on my private, self-hosted server at [git.cartbeforethe.horse](https://git.cartbeforethe.horse).

ICE is a fascist organization, responsible for conducting unspeakable horrors to immigrants, refugees, and others. Selling technology to ICE is a moral statement, and one that I cannot abide by.
